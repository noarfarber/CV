# Noa Farber

I am a recent Makers Academy graduate, an aspiring junior developer and have experience as a pastry chef in some of the top bakeries and restaurants in London. Creating something out of nothing was what drew me into both baking and coding. I take great pleasure in developing products that delight and seek to make an impact on people’s lives.

I am a detail-oriented problem solver with a passion for delightful user experience and using tech for good.
After working as a pastry chef for 10 years, I was looking for an intellectual challenge in an environment where I could learn new skills and create beautiful, useful products.

I started my programming journey with a Python for beginners course, and I was instantly hooked. I was thrilled by the endless opportunities and the amount of content I could learn from home. Following this eye-opening experience, I decided to deepen my knowledge and followed my friends’ recommendations to join Makers. During the course, I was amazed by the new skills I was learning in such a short time. I realised I can build anything using these tools and that everything is possible if I dedicate myself to a challenge. I believe I can leverage my hospitality experience along with my recently acquired coding skills to make a unique impact in tech.

## Skills

#### Self-learning
Once I decided to become a developer my task was clear; to learn as much as I can, gain hands-on experience and develop my coding skills.
I started with a self-led Python for beginners course and found that I enjoy learning on my own. I managed to learn the language without any prior experience with coding. Following this experience, I decided to deepen my knowledge and applied to Makers Academy. The requirements for joining the bootcamp were to complete a self-led Ruby course and to pass an interview. I completed the course, practised coding exercises, and read a lot to gain as much knowledge as I could, resulting in being accepted to join the course.
The bootcamp itself required learning a lot of material in a very short time and completing personal challenges over the weekends. I was able to implement my ability to motivate myself and continue to develop my skills to complete the bootcamp.

#### Team Work & Communication
When working in fast-paced kitchens, teamwork and communication are vital keys to a successful business.
In my last role at Pophams bakery, I was part of a brand new team that opened a new branch.
Our task was to open the bakery within the deadline while learning from scratch every step of the process to create the highest-standard pastries.
To maintain the production line organised and productive, we had to communicate well and work in collaboration. 
I created a system that helped us to keep track of each others' work, so each of us could start the shift with a clear plan for the day. The result was an organised and well-timed production and opening the bakery within the deadline.
My experience taught me that little can stand in the way of a dedicated team with a clear goal. This has been the driving force throughout my professional career and still guides me today.


## Hobbies and interests
* Weight lifting- I started training in weight lifting about a year ago. With no prior experience and within a short time, I managed to learn how to do pull-ups and can hip thrust 137.5 kg! I find learning this new set of skills empowering and life-changing.
* Hiking- I love travelling and hiking since my childhood. My most memorable hikes were to Abel Tasman National park in New Zealand and Yosemite in California. When travelling isn’t possible, I enjoy long walks in the park with my dog, Alfie.
