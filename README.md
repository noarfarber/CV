# Noa Farber

I am a recent Makers graduate, aspiring junior developer and have 10 years experience as a pastry chef in some of the best bakeries and restaurants in London. Creating something out of nothing was what drew me into both baking and coding. I take great pleasure in developing products that delight and seek to make an impact on people’s lives.
