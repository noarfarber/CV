# Noa Farber

I am a Makers Academy graduate, an aspiring junior developer and have experience as a pastry chef in some of the top bakeries and restaurants in London. Creating something out of nothing was what drew me into both baking and coding. I take great pleasure in developing products that delight and seek to make an impact on people’s lives.

I am a detail-oriented problem solver with a passion for delightful user experience and using tech for good.
After working as a pastry chef for 10 years, I was looking for an intellectual challenge in an environment where I could learn new skills and create beautiful, useful products.

I started my programming journey with a Python for beginners course, and I was instantly hooked. I was thrilled by the endless opportunities and the amount of content I could learn from home. Following this eye-opening experience, I decided to deepen my knowledge and followed my friends’ recommendations to join Makers. During the course, I was amazed by the new skills I was learning in such a short time. I realised I can build anything using these tools and that everything is possible if I dedicate myself to a challenge. I believe I can leverage my hospitality experience along with my recently acquired coding skills to make a unique impact in tech.
